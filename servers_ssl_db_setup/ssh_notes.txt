	SSH into digitalocean servers: 
****
create ssh keys:
ssh-keygen
add public key ".pub" to droplet in digitalocean.com under settings

- Connect to droplet:
- First ensure droplet is turned on in digitalocean dashboard
- Then connect to VPS from local machine terminal:
ssh -i /home/lctec/.ssh/id_rsa_digitalocean root@128.199.184.208
or
ssh root@128.199.184.208
- first time opening vps, update/upgrade packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
- exit out of terminal
- go to digitalocean and turn off server, then turn it back on to reboot it

- ssh again into server

- create user lctec
adduser lctec
- create password and enter user info
- add lctec to sudo group
usermod -aG sudo lctec
- verify sudo access, switch to lctec
su - lctec
- run a random sudo command:
ex.) sudo ls -la /root

- enter lctec password, not root password

- close terminal again and ssh into server as root user
- while logged in as root, 
- enable connecting to VPS with new user (lctec) instead of default (root):
*** the whitespace between ~/.ssh and /home/lctec is intentional **
rsync --archive --chown=lctec:lctec ~/.ssh /home/lctec
- exit out of terminal to disconnect from server as root
- from local computer terminal, run:
ssh -i /home/lctec/.ssh/id_rsa_digitalocean lctec@128.199.184.208
or
ssh lctec@128.199.184.208
- if you get denied (public key error), connect to VPS via root and run:
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
- change PasswordAuthentication from no to yes
- save ctrl-o, enter, ctrl-x 
- reload ssh
sudo service ssh reload
- close out of VPS terminal, open terminal on host computer and enter:
ssh-copy-id lctec@128.199.184.208
- enter password you made for lctec user
- you should receive this message on the console:

"Number of key(s) added: 4

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'lctec@128.199.184.208'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
"
- then run  (you probably have to enter password everytime now)
ssh lctec@128.199.184.208


- in local machine, add bash script to easily ssh into VPS (not required. Just makes things easier):
- create scripts directory:
mkdir scripts
- create bash script with ssh command:
sudo nano kag-ssh-server
#!/bin/bash

# Usage: ssh into kag vps

ssh lctec@128.199.184.208

- save it and make it an executable
chmod+x kag-ssh-server

- add the absolute path of this file to the ~/.bashrc directory
export PATH="$PATH:/full/path/to/your/script/directory"

- restart bashrc file
source ~/.bashrc

- now you can ssh into the server easily by opening up a terminal and entering:
kag-ssh-server

CONNECT VPS TO GITHUB REPO:

****
ssh dir: /home/lctec/.ssh
cd to /home/lctec and run:

ssh-keygen
give the key a name: 
your_ssh_key_name

Your identification has been saved in 
.ssh/your_ssh_key_name

Your public key has been saved in 
.ssh/your_ssh_key_name.pub

Now login to github and go to settings --> SSH and GPG Keys --> click New SSH key
Add the .pub key to git and save

* IMPORTANT *
Add newly created private ssh keys to ssh agent so that ssh can "see" this key
eval $(ssh-agent)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/your_key_name
- test ssh connection to github:
ssh -T git@github.com

Should see this (enter 'yes' for question prompt):

The authenticity of host 'github.com (20.205.243.166)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
Hi Crandy9! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.



- if Bad owner or permissions on /home/lctec/.ssh/config error, 
or ~/.ssh directory doesn't exist run:
sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh
sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*
- try again
- create config file:
cd to ~/.ssh:
touch config
- add public key located at .ssh/your_key_name.pub to GitHub ssh keys
use cat .ssh/your_key_name.pub to display public key for copying
